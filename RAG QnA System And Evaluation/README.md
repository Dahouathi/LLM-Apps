# LLM-Apps

This repository contains a collection of projects and applications built using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. These projects explore various capabilities of LLMs, including retrieval-augmented generation, question answering, and more.

## Projects in This Repository

### 1. [RAG QnA System with Evaluation](RAG%20QnA%20System%20with%20Evaluation/)

A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline for question answering, built using:
- **ChromaDB** for document retrieval.
- **Ollama Llama 3.2** for language generation.
- **BERTScore** and other metrics for evaluation.

This project demonstrates:
- How to integrate a retrieval-augmented pipeline with LLMs.
- A step-by-step implementation for evaluating QA systems on the QnA_v2 dataset.
  
#### Key Features:
- Customizable LLMs (use Hugging Face models or other integrations).
- Efficient retrieval and reranking with **ChromaDB** and **Cross-Encoder**.
- Comprehensive evaluation with metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore.
